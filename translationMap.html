Lars Sund \’s strange and insightful story raises questions about our attitudes towards other human beings. Prescient at the time it was written, A Happy Little Island is now sadly relevant. These refugees aren \’ t even alive, and yet the island people still fear and mistreat them. There \' s no need to house and feed them, treat their ailments, or help them find employment. Only to bury them, and even that seems impossible. The novel is also an acute observation of island life, and its double opening, first introducing the omniscient narrator and then the first encounter of a dead fugitive, is masterclass in writing.</p>';

The autobiographical novel’s strength lies in its nuanced exploration of refugee life: the alienation, the homesickness, the uneasy gratitude. Škėma’s protagonist, Antanas Garšva, was a poet in Lithuania and is a lift operator in New York – a menial job whose constant ups and downs mimic Garšva’s moods as he is haunted by the strangeness of his new life and vivid memories of his old one. It’s a mental state that he cannot sustain, and he’s losing his mind.</p><p>Originally banned in Lithuania and spurned by the émigré community in the US, the novel was first published by a London-based firm in 1958.</p><p>Learn more https://www.vagabondvoices.co.uk/bookshop-changelings/white-shroud</p>';

Its form – a diary that the author pretended to have not written but only edited – caused much controversy at the time of publication. The diary is written by Oskar, an Estonian university student who questions his motivations for falling in love with a Baltic German woman whose ancestors enslaved his. It’s a story about national self-confidence and how a people, when liberated, can remain trapped in their own inferiority complex. Tammsaare translated much of Oscar Wilde’s work, and it is in the personal story – a witty series of misunderstandings – that Wilde’s influence shows.</p><a href src=’https://www.vagabondvoices.co.uk/bookshop-changelings/i-loved-a-german’>Learn more </a></p>';

Destiny may not exist – who would believe they were destined to work in a mobile phone factory and starve and struggle? – but we can still encounter moments that cause even the most faithless to falter.
